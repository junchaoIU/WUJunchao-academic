abstract: In order to more efficiently meet people's in-depth needs for
  knowledge acquisition and research, and to more effectively develop and use
  "the Canton Canon" historical archives, we designed and constructed the Canton
  Revolutionary History Knowledge Graph based on the revolutionary archives of
  Canton during the Republic of China. We associated the knowledge graph with
  the document corpus, transformed and combined the traditional digital library
  from document information management to knowledge management, and proposed a
  double-Layer retrieval mode of the document corpus based on the knowledge
  graph. At the same time, we developed "the Canton Canon" digital library based
  on the knowledge graph, and introduced the design and application of the
  digital library. It provides a great example of how to use huge archives more
  efficiently and build a more open digital library. What's more, it also opens
  up new ideas for the transformation of Chinese digital libraries from
  information management to knowledge management.
